      <description>Why all companies should have a Heroku-like platform for their developers At Hootsuite, we try to host internal hackathons pretty frequently. Like any other hackathon, people come together, write some code and build something awesome. But often we noticed that these hacks tend on taking longer than expected to launch or get hosted somewhere. The need to wait for servers, databases or domains delays launching a hack.
In this blog post we will explore how and why at Hootsuite we created a simple PaaS on top of Kubernetes using Deis Workflow and added a few kinks to make prototyping easier for developers.</description>
