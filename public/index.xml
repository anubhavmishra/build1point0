I remember the first time I used Vagrantâ€¦. I ran vagrant up and my developer environment was up and running in minutes!
That feeling of using a piece of software and it doing exactly want you expected it to, does leave an impression on you. I never imagined that I would end up working for a company that creates software that makes people smile everyday. I am super happy to announce that I am joining HashiCorp as a Developer Advocate.</description>

      <description>At Hootsuite, we try to host internal hackathons pretty frequently. Like any other hackathon, people come together, write some code and build something awesome. But often we noticed that these hacks tend on taking longer than expected to launch or get hosted somewhere. The need to wait for servers, databases or domains delays launching a hack.
In this blog post we will explore how and why at Hootsuite we created a simple PaaS on top of Kubernetes using Deis Workflow and added a few kinks to make prototyping easier for developers.</description>
