I remember the first time I used Vagrantâ€¦. I ran vagrant up and my developer environment was up and running in minutes!
That feeling of using a piece of software and it doing exactly want you expected it to, does leave an impression on you. I never imagined that I would end up working for a company that creates software that makes people smile everyday. I am super happy to announce that I am joining HashiCorp as a Developer Advocate.</description>
